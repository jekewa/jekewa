# Quick Introduction

I'm @jekewa. 
In the real world, Jeff Warren.

I'm a long time lurker, and a little bit of user of GitHub. 
I use GitHub mostly for some vaguely open things, and third-party log-ins.
I do use git for version control, and either self-host or do most of my stuff on other installations.
I did tour GitHub offices while I was in San Francisco, and dig the software, but prefer to keep most of my projects to myself.

## Brief History

I started making software for others while in grade school in the 1970s, on an old teletype attached to a remote mainframe.
I embarked on a Math career, but changed to Computer Science early.
I thought I could do the things to have been Pixar, before they were Pixar, but instead found a career writing software for businesses.
From the mid-1990s to the mid-2010s I worked in a number of industries, for a number of companies, on a number of projects, as a consultant.
Since then, I've been leveraging all I have experienced and learned to help the engineers at my company do fantastic things.

# Interested In

I do all the computer things.
I build systems from components, starting with empty cases and going from there.
The basement is a mix of old system graveyard, and new system seeds.
I have a few enterprise servers I saved from eBay doing more heavy lifting, due to their large RAM.

I have a dozen or so hobby projects running on various servers.
I've tinkered in a number of languages and frameworks and domains.
I can't bring myself to finish any of them, though.
Thankfully, basement graveyard aside, having a bunch of abandoned digital projects doesn't take much room.

# Currently Learning

Mostly I'm refining my skills.
I have some hobby projects where I'm slurping large amounts of data for sports or weather, and I'm tinkering with how to do anything useful with Machine Learning with that data.
So far, nothing stellar, but still learning

# Collaboration

I'm open to chatting about all the nerd things.
I spend most of my time with work or family, and the hobby takes a deep backseat to other obligations.
While I'd probably enjoy digging into whatever breaks for others, I seldom feel like I could do justice or commit enough time to be rewarding.

Happy to try, though.

# Connecting

I'm *jekewa* on most of the popular services, so I should be easy to find.
My own domain is [jekewa.com](https://jekewa.com/), and there's a message page there.

Like here, I mostly view [Twitter](//twitter.com/jekewa), but get messages through there OK.
I'm mostly avoiding [Facebook](//facebook.com/jekewa), but it's there.
I also use [GitLab](//gitlab.com/jekewa), sometimes more than GitHub, although there my projects tend to be private.
